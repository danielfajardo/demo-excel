# Demo Excel

This is the code used in the very first session of the Python talks, where I introduced the basics of Python.

## Motivation

 1. Simplify the life of those who have to copy data from an excel **A** to a **B**
 2. Show that some repetitive tasks could be automated easily, saving a lot of time!

## How to run the script

You must have installed Python 3 in your system. Then run:

    python excel.py -fo <filename_A> -fd <filename_B>

## Notes

 - This code is not a generic solution. If you want to use it for other case specialization, you must edit the excel.py file.
 - It has been developed for teaching purposes.
